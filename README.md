## functions

### 1.  Searching Data
Use the search bar located at the top of the page to filter the table based on:
First Name      |       Last Name     |       Email
The search is not case-sensitive. You can either press the "Enter" key after typing your search query or click the "Search" button to update the table data.

### 2.  Sorting Data
Use the following buttons below the table to sort the data:
  Sort A->Z: Sort in ascending order of full name.
  Sort Z->A: Sort in descending order of full name.
  Sort by Marks: Sort in ascending order of marks.
  Sort by Passing: Show only students who are passing.
  Sort by Class: Sort in ascending order of class.
  
## 3.  Gender-Based Sorting

Click the "Sort by Gender" button to display two separate tables:
  The first table contains all female students.
  The second table contains all male students.
  Both tables are shown one below the other for easy comparison.
  
### 4.  Customization
  Feel free to customize the project by modifying the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to meet your specific requirements. You can style the UI and add additional features as needed.
